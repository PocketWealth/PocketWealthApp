# PocketWealth

## Description
An open-source application that allows canadians to track their personal wealth. PocketWealth is an (upcoming)
application that will allow users to track their personal finances using a private and local application. The goal
of pocket wealth is to provide a personal wealth tracker that doesn't require sharing information with 3rd parties
or comprising privacy. The application is designed to be self hosted by users, so the information you provide
never leaves your computer or server. It will allow users to track stocks, cash, TFSA, RRSP, and other investments
available to canadians.
